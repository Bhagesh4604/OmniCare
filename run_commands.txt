**Step-by-Step Guide to Run the Project:**

This guide assumes that you have already copied the project to a new location.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Node.js and npm:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Android Studio:** Make sure you have Android Studio installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have a JDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

**Steps:**

1.  **Open a terminal** in the root directory of the project.

2.  **Install Node Modules:** Run the following command to install the required node modules:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Update Environment Variables:**
    *   Open the `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Review the values of the environment variables and update them if necessary.
    *   Specifically, make sure that the database credentials (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_DATABASE`) and the API keys (`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`) are correct.

4.  **Start the Backend Server:** Run the following command to start the backend server:
    ```
    npm run server
    ```
    You should see the message "Server is running on port 8080".

5.  **Build the Frontend App:** Open a **new terminal** in the root directory of the project and run the following command to build the frontend app:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` directory with the built frontend assets.

6.  **Sync with Capacitor:** Run the following command to sync the web assets with the Android project:
    ```
    npx cap sync
    ```

7.  **Open in Android Studio:** Run the following command to open the Android project in Android Studio:
    ```
    npx cap open android
    ```

8.  **Run on Android:**
    *   In Android Studio, wait for the project to sync.
    *   Connect your Android device to your computer or start an Android emulator.
    *   Click the "Run" button (the green triangle) in the Android Studio toolbar to build and run the app on your device or emulator.
