PROJECT REPORT: Shree Medicare HMS (Detailed)

=========================
1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
=========================

Hospitals and healthcare facilities operate in a high-stakes environment where efficiency, accuracy, and patient care are paramount. The reliance on outdated, manual, or disparate digital systems presents several critical problems:

- **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual data entry, paper-based record keeping, and phone-based appointment scheduling lead to significant administrative overhead, reducing the time staff can dedicate to patient care and increasing operational costs.

- **Risk of Medical Errors:** Inaccurate or inaccessible patient information is a major risk. Errors in medical records, prescriptions, or lab results due to manual processes can lead to incorrect diagnoses, adverse drug events, and compromised patient safety.

- **Fragmented Patient Journey:** Without a centralized system, a patient's data is siloed across various departments. This fragmentation results in a disconnected patient experience, requiring them to repeatedly provide the same information and leading to delays in treatment as departments struggle to coordinate.

- **Lack of Patient Engagement:** The modern patient expects digital access to their health information. The absence of a patient portal for viewing records, scheduling appointments, and managing bills leads to dissatisfaction and a lack of empowerment in their own healthcare journey.

- **Financial Leakage:** Inefficient billing processes and poor inventory management result in financial losses, from missed revenue opportunities to wastage of expired medical supplies.


=========================
2. LITERATURE SURVEY
=========================

A review of Hospital Management Systems (HMS) reveals a clear technological progression towards integrated, intelligent, and patient-centric platforms.

- **Evolution from Monoliths to Micro-services:** Early HMS were monolithic client-server systems. The industry has since shifted to web-based and now cloud-native architectures. Modern systems often use a service-oriented or micro-service architecture, allowing for greater scalability and easier integration of new functionalities.

- **The Centrality of Electronic Health Records (EHR):** The adoption of EHRs is the cornerstone of modern healthcare IT. An EHR provides a real-time, comprehensive digital chart of a patient's history. Interoperability standards like HL7 and FHIR have been developed to allow these records to be shared securely across different healthcare systems.

- **The Rise of Patient-Centric Technology:** The concept of the "e-patient" has driven the development of patient portals. Studies show that patients who are more engaged in their healthcare experience better outcomes. Portals provide direct access to lab results, appointment scheduling, and communication with providers, fostering this engagement.

- **Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare:** AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a practical tool. Its applications in HMS include:
    - **Administrative Automation:** AI can parse unstructured clinical notes, generate summaries, draft communications, and manage schedules, as demonstrated in this project's AI assistant features.
    - **Clinical Decision Support:** AI models can assist clinicians by identifying patterns in medical images or data that might be missed by the human eye.
    - **Predictive Analytics:** Analyzing large datasets to predict patient admissions, disease outbreaks, or resource needs.


=========================
3. EXISTING SYSTEM
=========================

The existing system is characterized by manual, paper-based, and non-integrated digital processes. This leads to several dysfunctional workflows:

- **Patient Registration:** A cumbersome, in-person process involving physical forms, leading to data entry errors and long wait times.
- **Appointment Booking:** Reliant on phone calls, leading to scheduling conflicts, no visibility into doctor availability for the patient, and a high administrative burden on front-desk staff.
- **Medical Records:** Stored in physical files, making them difficult to retrieve, impossible to access remotely, and susceptible to loss or damage.
- **Billing Cycle:** A manual process of generating invoices, tracking payments, and following up on receivables, resulting in delays and financial inaccuracies.
- **Inventory Control:** Manual stock-taking for the pharmacy and medical equipment, leading to stockouts of critical items or overstocking and wastage.


=========================
4. PROPOSED SYSTEM
=========================

The Shree Medicare HMS is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to overcome the limitations of the existing system. It is a centralized, modular, and intelligent solution for modern hospital management.

**System Modules:**
- **Patient Portal:** Allows patients to register, book appointments based on real-time doctor schedules, view their medical history, and manage their profile.
- **Staff Portal:** Provides role-based access for doctors and administrators.
- **Dashboard:** Offers a real-time, at-a-glance overview of key hospital metrics like patient numbers, bed availability, and revenue.
- **Patient Management:** Centralized module for registering and managing all patient demographic data.
- **Doctor Schedule Module:** A dedicated interface for doctors to manage their weekly work availability.
- **Appointment Module:** Allows staff to view all appointments and patients to book them based on doctor availability.
- **Medical Records Module:** A digital repository for all patient diagnoses and treatments.
- **Pharmacy & Inventory Modules:** Manages pharmaceutical stock, medical equipment, and reorder levels.
- **Accounting & Payroll Modules:** Handles accounts payable/receivable and employee payroll.
- **AI & SMS Modules:** Integrates AI for administrative assistance and Twilio for sending SMS notifications.


=========================
5. SYSTEM OF ARCHITECTURE
=========================

The system is built on a modern, three-tier architecture to ensure a separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.

- **Presentation Tier (Frontend):** A dynamic and responsive user interface built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It is a Single-Page Application (SPA) that communicates with the backend via REST API calls. It is responsible for all user interaction and data visualization.

- **Logic Tier (Backend):** A robust API server built on **Node.js** with the **Express.js** framework. This tier contains all the business logic, handles user authentication and authorization, processes data, and orchestrates communication between the frontend, the database, and external services.

- **Data Tier (Database):** A **MySQL** relational database provides persistent storage for all application data. The schema is designed with normalized tables and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity and consistency.

**Data Flow Example (Appointment Booking):**
1. Patient selects a doctor and date in the React frontend.
2. Frontend sends an API request to the Node.js backend (`/api/schedules/available-slots/...`).
3. Backend queries the MySQL database for the doctor's schedule and existing appointments.
4. Backend calculates available slots and returns them to the frontend.
5. Patient selects a slot, and the frontend sends a `POST` request to `/api/portal/book-appointment`.
6. Backend validates the request and inserts the new appointment into the `appointments` table in the MySQL database.


=========================
